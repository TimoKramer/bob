# Bob the Builder

## This is what CI/CD should've been.

### [Why](https://bob-cd.github.io/bob/why-bob) Bob

## ðŸš§ This is a proof of concept and isn't fully functional yet. ðŸš§
See the Kanban [board](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob/projects/1) to see the roadmap and planned work.

## Build requirements
- Any OS supporting Java and Docker
- JDK 8+ (latest preferred for optimal performance)
- [Boot](https://boot-clj.com/) 2.7+

## Running requirements
- Any OS supporting Java and Docker
- JRE 8+ (latest preferred for optimal performance)
- Docker (latest preferred for optimal performance)

## Testing, building and running
- Clone this repository.
- Install the Build requirements.
- Following steps **need Docker**:
    - Run `boot kaocha` to run tests.
    - Run `boot build` to get the standalone JAR.
    - Run `java -jar ./target/bob-standalone.jar` to start the server on port **7777**.

## Running Bob in Docker
Bob uses Docker as its engine to execute builds, but its now possible to run Bob
inside Docker using [dind](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker).

To use the latest pre-built image:
- `docker pull bobcd/bob:latest`

To build locally, in the root of this repo, run:
- `docker build -t bobcd/bob:latest .`

Then run the container:
- `docker run --rm -it -p 7777:7777 --privileged bobcd/bob:latest`

Bob will be up on the forwarded host port `7777` and can run normally.
The `--privileged` flag is crucial as Bob uses system calls that are not usually
allowed on Docker.

## Running integration tests:

**Docker needs to be installed for this**

In the `integration-tests` dir, run:

`docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit`

## For Cursive users:
This project is built using the Boot build tool which is unsupported on Cursive at the moment.

### To get it running on Cursive using leiningen:
- Install [Boot](https://boot-clj.com/) 2.7+.
- Install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) 2.8+.
- Run `boot -d onetom/boot-lein-generate generate` to generate a `project.clj`.
- Open up this directory in Cursive and it should work.
- Happy development!
