## This is what [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) should've been.

### [Why](https://bob-cd.github.io/pages/why-bob.html) Bob

## ðŸš§ This is a proof of concept and isn't fully functional yet. ðŸš§
See the Kanban [board](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob/projects/1) to see the roadmap and planned work.

### ðŸš§ Warning: This branch is for the upcoming version of Bob and is going through heavy development and flux, for the earlier version see this [branch](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob/tree/master).

### Check out the [Getting Started](https://bob-cd.github.io/pages/getting-started.html) guide.

## Components

The core of Bob is an amalgamation of 3 main services:
- [API server](/apiserver)
- [Entities](/entities)
- [Runner](/runner)

Bob follows the idea of [simpler, decomposed and hence more composable and unbundled design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCZ3YgeEUPg).

All of these services live, breathe and deploy from their own section of this mono-repo and post-deployment, they are coordinated via a central persistent queue. Read more about Bob's [architecture](https://bob-cd.github.io/pages/architecture.html).

## Join the conversation

For a more Clojure specific discussion we also have a Clojurians Slack [channel](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/CPBAYJJF6).

You can come with us with any questions that seem too lengthy for github issues.

Happy Building!
